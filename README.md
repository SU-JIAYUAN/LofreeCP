# LofreeCP
LofreeCP aims to address the pervasive challenge of quantifying uncertainty in large language models (LLMs) without logit-access by formulating nonconformity measures using both coarse-grained (i.e., sample frequency) and fine-grained uncertainty notions (e.g., normalized entropy & semantic similarity).

## **üõ†Ô∏è** About LofreeCP

1. **First Step: Sampling Responses**
    - Run `run_generation.py` to generate and sample responses. I suggest you use transformers Version: 4.32.0.
  
2. **Second Step: Conformal Prediction**
    - After collecting all the responses, run `run_cp.py` to apply our conformal prediction method.
